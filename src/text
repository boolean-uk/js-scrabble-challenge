Input a word
    Check IF its a string
        Return if not a string ' this is not a string '
Initialise an empty array
Loop through the word inputting every character into the array
    Satisfying when it reaches the .length of the string

Now the array is initialised correctly
    
    Use a loop to loop through the array
Initialise a count and for every value that satisfies the case, add 1 per letter

Continue to use conditional statements within the loop to keep updating the count

Eventually print the count when the loop is satisfied
