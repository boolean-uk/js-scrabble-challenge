take the string and assign a value to each letter in the string from a pre-determined kist,
once i have those values i add all those values together and find a result that gets returned as the final value 

psuedo code:
assighn vaules to letters given const variables

use a for loop sto go through the index of a string and the charAt() look at each charachter in the string
comparing the chachters to vaulues assighned to those charachters if ('a' ==== 'a') { }
