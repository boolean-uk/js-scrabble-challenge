# Extension

## Requirements
- My solution should support the ability to define specific letters as double and triple score.
  - `do{u}ble` for a double letter score
  - `tr[i]ple` for a triple letter score
- Similar to above, my solution should support the ability to define double and triple word scores.
  - `{double}` for a double word score
  - `[triple]` for a triple word score
    
## Edge cases
- `do}g`, `do{g`, `do]g` and `do[g`    should return 0
- `{[d]og}` should return 18 

## Implementations
### 1
00 Create a multiplier variable, which we will multiply the characters' score by.
00 Validate the string for lone `]` or `}`, and also for unacceptable characters such as `|`.
1. Start looping through the string as normal.
2. If a `{` is encoutered, double the multiplier. When a `}` is encountered, halve the multiplier.
3. Similarly, if a `[` is encoutered, triple the multiplier. When a `]` is encountered, third the multiplier.

### 2
Using the match function:
00 Validate the string for lone `]` or `}`, and also for unacceptable characters such as `|`. If invalid, return 0.
  - If match() return null, but `string` still contains `[`, `]`, `{` or `}` => invalidate
1. Using the match() function, find the first instance of `{}` or `[]`.
  - find the score for the string inside of `{}` or `[]` including the relevant multiplier.
  - Remove the matched string (including `{}` or `[]`) from the input string.
  - Repeat until match() returns `null`.
2. Loop through the remaining string and calculate its score (no multiplier).
