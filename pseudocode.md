# Pseudocode

#### Add the steps you need to take to implement the requirements for Scrabble Challenge

```txt
1. Create a map/dictionary with all the letters of the alphabet as keys and their corresponding scores as values.

2. Create an array with all the valid characters

Scrubble Function:
1. Define a variable with an initial value of 0 that will hold the accumulated score

2. Check if input string is valid, otherwise return an empty string, so that score is 0

3. Convert the input string, such that the {...} and [...] are replaced with 2 and 3 times accordingly the included substring.

2. Parse all characters of the converted string and add each character's score, according to the map/dictionary, to the score variable

3. Return the score variable
