# Pseudocode

#### Add the steps you need to take to implement the requirements for Scrabble Challenge

```
Standard:

1. Create a variable that stores a string to be assessed for scrabble points.

2. Create a for loop that runs through the characters of the string (as an array of characters).

3. Use conditional statements to evaluate each character for points using the defined points table.

Extended:

1. Use a regex to search through the string and return a substring of any characters encapsulated in {} or []

2. Double or triple the points tally of that letter using the scrable function created above

3. Use a regex to search through the string and return a substring of any words encapsulated in {} or []

4. Double or triple the points tally of that entire word using the scrable function created above
